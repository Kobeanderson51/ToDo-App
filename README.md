<!-- # ToDo-App
A simple To-Do List Application is a dynamic and feature-rich web-based task management tool designed to help users efficiently organize their tasks, projects, and to-do lists. This project aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for task management, prioritization, and collaboration. It offers a comprehensive set of functionalities, allowing users to create multiple lists, manage tasks within each list, and enhance productivity.

Project Structure and Documentation:

Organize your project with a clear folder structure, separating HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.
Add a well-written README.md file with information about the project, its features, and instructions on how to use it.
Version Control with Git:

Make sure you use Git for version control.
Commit your changes regularly with meaningful commit messages.

User Interface (UI) Improvements:

Enhance the visual design of your app with responsive CSS.
Use a modern UI framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to improve the overall look and feel.
